//! # Smart Leds Trait
//!
//! Smart leds is a collection of crates to use smart leds on embedded devices with rust.
//!
//! Examples of smart leds include the popular WS2812 (also called Neopixel),
//! APA102 (DotStar) and other leds, which can be individually adressed.
//!
//! This crate is used as a common base, so that breaking changes which would
//! force all other crates to be updated, can be avoided.
//!
//! End users should use the [smart-leds](https://crates.io/crates/smart-leds)
//! crate, which contains various convenience functions.
