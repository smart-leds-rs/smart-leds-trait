//! # Smart Leds Trait
//!
//! Smart leds is a collection of crates to use smart leds on embedded devices with rust.
//!
//! Examples of smart leds include the popular WS2812 (also called Neopixel),
//! APA102 (DotStar) and other leds, which can be individually adressed.
//!
//! This crate is used as a common base, so that breaking changes which would
//! force all other crates to be updated, can be avoided.
//!
//! End users should use the [smart-leds](https://crates.io/crates/smart-leds)
//! crate, which contains various convenience functions.

    // no_std async executors don't require futures to be Send. Also, embedded-hal-async
    // does not have Send bounds in its traits, so the HAL functions called in
    // implementations of this trait wouldn't return Send futures anyway. It's
    // questionable if it would be desirable for embedded HALs to return a Send future
    // for the write function for a peripheral because you probably don't want to
    // write data to the same peripheral from multiple threads simultaneously and have
    // the data get interleaved, nor have the embedded HAL implement a synchronization
    // mechanism with a run time cost to avoid that.
